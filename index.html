<h2  style="background-color:rgba(255, 99, 71, 0.4);">My experiences</h2>
 <h3 style="color: coral"> They have come to North American before but I was not able to see them at that time. But I am still glad that I have been to their concerts for several times in other places. The recent one was when they held the corcert in Hong Kong on June 2. This date is also my birthday, so I really have a nice memory with them. That was a really awesome huge party! The atmosphere was amazing; the light was amazing; everything was amazing! I went to see them with my friend who has the same interest of Exo like me, and we saw two-day concerts together. We were so close to stage and totally intoxicated with the spirit of the fantastic show. We both had a really really great time. Below is a short video that I recorded. This is a slow song and almost the last song they performed. The lifting platform added more fun for the show. Let's appreciate it!
